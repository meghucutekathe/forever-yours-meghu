        <h2>My Dearest Meghu,</h2>
        <p>
            First, I just want to say <b>thank you for waiting</b>. By the time you open this, it will be your special day‚Äî 
            <b>July 27th</b>, the day the world was blessed with your presence. I know waiting isn't always easy, but you did, and that means the world to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meghu, I love you <b>more than words can ever express</b>. You are the light in my life, the reason behind my smiles, and the warmth in my heart.
            From the moment you became a part of my world, everything changed. You made me believe in love again, in happiness, in the beauty of waiting for the right person.
            And that person is <b>you</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't just love you for how beautiful you are‚ÄîI love you for the <b>kind heart</b> you have, for the way you understand me, for the way you make even the hardest days feel lighter.
            You are my <b>safe place</b>, the one person I can always count on, the one who makes my world feel complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            You know, I often think about our future. A life where I wake up every day knowing that <b>you are mine and I am yours</b>.
            I dream of the moments when I'll get to take care of you, support you, celebrate your successes, and hold you through your struggles.
            I promise, no matter what happens, I will always <b>choose you</b>‚Äîagain and again, every single day.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want you to know that <b>you are the greatest blessing in my life</b>.
            If I ever fail to show it, if I ever fall short in expressing it, please remember this letter.
            You are my everything, Meghu, and I will love you till my last breath and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
            So on this special day, I just want to say: <b>Happy Birthday, my love!</b>
            May this year bring you as much happiness as you bring into my life.
            And remember, no matter where life takes us, my heart will always belong to you.
        </p>
        <p><b>With all my love,</b><br> Your Puttu ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
